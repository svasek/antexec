    Runs Apache Ant tasks as a build file with only one target. The script will be run with workspace
    as the current directory. Build will be considered as failure if any Ant task fails.<br>
    You can use <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/tasks/tasks/index.html">Ant-Contrib tasks</a> (if it is
    enabled in global configuration). You need to use namespace "antcontrib" (example: "&lt;antcontrib:if&gt;").
